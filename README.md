# Compilation of Smart Contracts projects.

A smart contract is a computer program that facilitates, secures, enforces, and executes recorded agreements between two or more parties (for example, people or organizations). As such they would assist you in negotiating and defining such agreements that will cause certain actions to happen as a result of specific conditions being met.
